# Full Stack React App with a Rest API

### Welcome to the Client for my Full Stack React App for the Team Treehouse: FSJS Techdegree - Unit 10 Project.

In this final project, I used React to create a client for my existing [School Database REST API](https://github.com/kyleines/School-Database-REST-API), which I created in a previous project. The full stack application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing details for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. Implementing these features pushed my React skills to new heights.

To complete this project, I used my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

After using the Create React App tool to set up my initial project, I:
- Used JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for my application in a modular fashion.
- Used React Router to set up my routes.
- Used the Fetch API to fetch data from my REST API.
- Allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.
- Added to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.

Thanks for visiting! \
Feedback, follows, and stars are all appreciated!

### Developer's Notes:
- Using [React-Markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown), I added support for rendering markdown formatted text when creating new courses.
